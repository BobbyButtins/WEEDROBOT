# WEEDROBOT
**Cal Poly SLO, Mechanical Engineering Senior Project**

September 2022 - June 2023

The project is a large turtle-shaped weed cutting robot. Weeds are cut using a scooper system containing two scooper halves. One halve has a secured blade that shears the weeds. These weeds are then transported to an opening near the top of the shell, where it will pass through a shredder and the remains will be kept in a storage container. The implemented code allows for the robot to be controlled via remote control. 

Functions of the robot include:

-scooper cutting (opening/closing scooper)

-scooper lifting (raising/lowering scooper)

-full forward and reverse drive with turning

-shredding (on/off)

-limited weed identification(?)

-storage door movement (opening/closing)
