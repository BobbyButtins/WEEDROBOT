# WEEDROBOT
**Cal Poly SLO, Mechanical Engineering Senior Project**

September 2022 - June 2023

The project is a large turtle-shaped weed cutting robot. Weeds are cut using a scooper system containing two C-shaped extrusions that can interface together to form a basket-like container. One half has a secured blade that shears the weeds. These weeds are then transported to an opening near the top of the shell, where it will pass through a shredder and the remains will be kept in a storage container. All actions are to be controlled using a PS4 DualShock4 controller via Bluetooth connection. 

Functions of the robot include:

-weed cutting (opening/closing scooper)

-weed transporting (raising/lowering scooper arms)

-full forward and reverse drive with turning

-storage door movement (opening/closing)

[FUTURE IMPLEMENTATION]
-shredding (on/off)

-weed identification
